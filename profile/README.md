> "We move fast, hit hard, and vanish before anyone notices."  

Welcome to the lair of **10sec-in-shadows** — a UK-based dev squad obsessed with building crazy, high-energy, borderline dangerous code that somehow works.  

We’re the creators behind **[The Mafia Project](https://themafiaproject.studio)**, where strategy, chaos, and multiplayer madness collide. Made with ❤️ and a hint of caffeine-induced mania.

## 🌌 Who We Are

- A small but ruthless dev team pushing limits in **Node.js, Go, and whatever else breaks things**.  
- We love **fast prototypes, chaotic experiments, and creating projects that make people stop and stare**.  
- Our motto: **“If it doesn’t crash spectacularly at least once, did we even code?”**
